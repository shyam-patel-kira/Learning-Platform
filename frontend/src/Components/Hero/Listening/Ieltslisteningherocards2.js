                        <b>Improve general listening skills:</b> In order to improve the listening skills one should listen to the radio talks, Ted-Talks of native English speakers, documental programs, etc. 
                        Only giving practice tests will not elevate the performance of the examiner instead the examiner will get friendly only to the type of questions asked.

                        <b>Focus:</b> The candidate should not lose concentration at any cost as the audio is only played once. 
                        In some cases it might happen that if a candidate loses one answer then there is a chance that he/she might lose another answer due to pressure. 
                        Hence, it is extremely vital to remain focused during the whole examination.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Don’t leave any answers:</b> As there is no negative marking in the examination candidates should always attempt all the answers even if they have doubt in some answers.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Check for mistakes:</b> After the completion of each section one is given the time of 30 seconds to check all the answers.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Don’t write answers promptly:</b> Many candidates fall into this trap easily as they write the answers quickly by just listening to the audio related to the answers. 
                        The candidates should listen properly to the contractions which are used in the audio and after listening to it only they should write the correct answer.
