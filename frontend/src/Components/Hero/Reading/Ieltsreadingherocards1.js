                            IELTS Reading is of two types:

                                Academic Reading 
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                                General Reading
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The candidate should definitely decide which exam they are going to give and if they are confused then they can definitely reach out to the British Council or IDP.
