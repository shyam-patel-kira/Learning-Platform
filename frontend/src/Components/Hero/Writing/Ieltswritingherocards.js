                            IELTS Writing is divided into tasks for both the general and academic candidates:
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The candidate has to write a minimum 150 words and 250 words in Task-1 and Task-2 respectively, else bands will be deducted. 
                            However, there is no upper limit defined but it is advised to write between 150-180 words for Task-1 and 250-280 words for Task-2. 
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The more one writes then there are chances of making errors also which in result leads to getting less bands.
                        </li>
                       
                        <li>
                            Task-1 of Writing accounts for 33% of the writing bands result whereas Task-2 comprises 67%.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            It is advised to complete Task-1 in 20 minutes and Task-2 in 40 minutes. 
                            The total examination length of writing is exactly 1 hour.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            For IELTS Academic candidates Task-1 includes report writing whereas for General students Task-1 consists of Letter Writing. 
                            Task-2 of IELTS writing is same for both the candidates.
